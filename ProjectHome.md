A simple application for resizing images,inspired by GTPY - ImageResizer (http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=32338), <br />
but I used C++/QT and QImage class to convert the images.
SIR - Simple Image Resizer can convert into and from the following formats:

  * JPEG
  * PNG
  * BMP
  * GIF
  * XPM
  * PGM
  * PBM
  * PPM

SIR also can rotate your images.

To compile:

`$>qmake sir.pro && make`
